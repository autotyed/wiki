Autotyed isn't really a piece of software you install. We've provided some scripts
that automate the installation and auto-startup of some very popular open source
software. Some of these applications have package maintainers, but not really
for MacOS. Many of them lack unix-like auto-start capabilities and log file control.
Autotyed ties all of that together and makes is easy to do.

For now, we're only able to provide scripts, launch agents and instructions for
MacOS, but we're leaving room to add more platforms in time. Help is requested.
